## Introduction

Themosis is an open-source project and anyone can contribute to it. Themosis contains multiple repositories and they're all stored on Github.

If you feel confident writing code, we have 4 repositories handling the different parts of the framework:

- [themosis/themosis](https://github.com/themosis/themosis): application skeleton providing full code structure for a collaborative development, installing the latest WordPress version, dependencies and a default theme.
- [themosis/framework](https://github.com/themosis/framework): framework core containing all APIs.
- [themosis/theme](https://github.com/themosis/theme): theme boilerplate for developing your application front-end.
- [themosis/plugin](https://github.com/themosis/plugin): plugin boilerplate for developing custom plugins.

For each of these repositories, you can accordingly report any **code issues** you may find or provide pull requests.

> Please make sure to double-check before posting a code issue. All framework code issues should be reported on the [themosis/framework](https://github.com/themosis/framework) repository only.

We also need help on the documentation. If you see grammar typos or think the docs are lacking some explanation or examples, feel free to complete it:
